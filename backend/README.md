# ðŸ“ˆ NFT Factory Backend

Server logic for the NFT Factory dApp monorepo

## ðŸ”§ Setting up Local Development

Required:

- [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Make sure that:

- Smart contracts are built and deployed to a live hardhat network (`contracts/yarn chain`)
- Artifacts and .env are synced (`home/sync.sh`)

```bash
# install deps
$ yarn
$ yarn start:dev
```

The server is now running at `http://localhost:3333`!
Open postman and start querying!

Make sure your Metamask chainId is 31337. It is 1337 by default.

This code is not audited. It is not recommended to deploy to mainnet.
